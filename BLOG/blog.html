        <h1>Tennessee Vols Head Coach Search</h1>
        <p>Tennessee's coaching search to replace Jeremy Pruitt has ended with UCF's Josh Heupel taking over in Knoxville in 2021. Heupel marks the fifth coach on Rocky Top over the last 13 seasons. Athletic director Danny White hired Heupel at UCF, so there's no doubt the familiarity should help as Tennessee moves forward to rebuild its football program.

        <p>The Volunteers have posted seven losing seasons since 2010, recorded only one year of more than nine victories since '05, and finished in the top 25 just two times since '08. That's a long fall from winning at least eight games every year from 1989 to 2004.
        </p>
        <p>Pruitt's dismissal left a long list of question marks for the next coaching staff to address. Potential NCAA sanctions are looming, a handful of key players entered the transfer portal, and a new staff inherits a team that won just three games in 2020.

        <p>Heupel – a former Oklahoma quarterback – isn't stepping into a program that's firing on all cylinders. Instead, this is a rebuilding project. Heupel has a solid resume from stops at Oklahoma (2006-14), Utah State, Missouri, and as UCF's head coach.
        </p>
        <p>Is Heupel the right hire to get Tennessee's program back on track? Let's take a look at three reasons why this hire will work out better than Pruitt and three reasons it could fail:

        <p>Winning at a high level in this era of college football requires an elite offense (as evidenced by the College Football Playoff teams and national champions). Heupel has excelled in this department. UCF averaged more than 42 points a game and 6.6 yards per play in all three of his seasons in Orlando. The Knights were also one of the best in college football at producing big plays during Heupel's tenure. The Volunteers can also expect a fast pace to run as many plays as possible. UCF ran 75.8 plays a game in 2018, 78.2 in '19, and 85.9 in '20.
